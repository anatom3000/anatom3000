### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be quiet.😄
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on nothing (for now).
- 📫 How to reach me: join me on Discord : `Anatom#5925`
- 👍 I like math, physics, video games (I don't know why I put a 's' to "games", I play only Minecraft🤔) and programming.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm programming mainly for my hobbies, and because it's fun to want to make a project and then make it !
